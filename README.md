# TamaAPI - A CLI tool for the TLV API

### This is a simple CLi tool written in Go for finding out if there is construction around an address in Tel Aviv.  
## How to run:
```
go run main.go radius  
```
this will run the main file locally and will execute the radius command. This command (for now) will only contact the TLV municipality API for retrieving all constuction requests from 2024. 

Later, logic for finding construction in a radius of an address will be added.
